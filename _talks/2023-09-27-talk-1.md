I had the honor of being invited as the guest speaker to an online workshop on Generative AI, hosted by the University of Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

It was a privilege to share my insights with the faculty, students at Tabuk University and the public audience, who are known for their interests and achievements in innovation. The event was recorded and can be watched at: [https://youtu.be/OTXPX786SSU](https://youtu.be/OTXPX786SSU)

I am thrilled to have been part of this event and look forward to more opportunities to collaborate and explore the exciting possibilities that technology offers in many industries.
