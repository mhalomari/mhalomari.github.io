I had the honor of being invited as the guest speaker to an online workshop on Generative AI, hosted by the University of Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

I am deeply honored to have had the opportunity to impart my insights to the esteemed faculty, students, and the wider public audience at Tabuk University. It was truly exhilarating to delve into the practical applications of AI, showcasing cutting-edge models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Through engaging discussions, I aimed to provide them with a firsthand experience of the remarkable progress in artificial intelligence, offering a tangible understanding of its real-world implications.
