I was privileged to serve as the keynote speaker at an online workshop on Generative AI, graciously hosted by the University of Tabuk in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Having the opportunity to share my expertise with the esteemed faculty, students, and the broader community of Tabuk University was a profound honor. Exploring the practical applications of AI, I showcased cutting-edge models like ChatGPT and GPT-4, making the session both informative and inspiring. Through engaging discussions, my goal was to provide attendees with a firsthand experience of the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence, offering a concrete understanding of its real-world implications.

The event was recorded and is now available for viewing at: [https://youtu.be/OTXPX786SSU](https://youtu.be/OTXPX786SSU). I am truly grateful for the enriching experience and the chance to contribute to the academic discourse on AI.
